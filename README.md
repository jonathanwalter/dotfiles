# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. There are many like it, but these ones are mine. My dotfiles are my best friend. They are my life. I must master them as I master my life.

My dotfiles, without me, are useless. Without my dotfiles I am useless.

## Setting up

### 1. Clone the repo

```
git clone https://gitlab.com/jonathanwalter/dotfiles.git
```

### 2. Run `init.sh`

Run the init script:

This will install stow and zsh if needed, and then run stow.

It will also install vim plugins.
